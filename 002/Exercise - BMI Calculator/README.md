[BMI Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index)

The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height. For example, if a tall person and a short

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

**NOTE:** You should convert the BMI to a whole number and print out a whole number in order to pass all the tests. See
examples below.

### Example 1 Input

```
1.75
80
```

This means:
weight = 80 and height = 1.75

### Example 1 Output

```
26
```

Since: 80 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837

### Example Input 2

```
1.58
57
```

### Example Output 2

```
22
```
