## Instructions

Write a program that prints the number of characters in a name.

**HINT:** You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.

For example, you can check this
link: [How to get the length of a string in Python - Stack Overflow](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+the+length+of+a+string+in+python+stack+overflow)

**Warning:** Your program should work for different inputs, such as any name that you input.

**NOTE:** You can access the value in the input pane using the `input()` function.

**IMPORTANT:** Don't add anything inside the `input()` function. For example, use `name = input()` rather
than `name = input("What's your name?")`.

### Example Input

```Jane```

### Example Output

```4```
